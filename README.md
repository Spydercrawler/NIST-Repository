# NIST-Repository

This contains all the files I created and worked on while I was working at NIST. This includes multiple versions of the module I worked on while I was there. 
The most final version of the module can be found in the folder "New Module Folder". If you need the actual module, There should be another repository containing the final
module code, examples, and documentation.

Versions before august 1st, 2017 will only have a readme file, that contains no information. This is because I was still learning how to use github at that time, and those versions were me experimenting.
